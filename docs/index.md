# Vulgar Application Stack

The Vulgar Application Stack is an attempt to identify a "best choice" combination of web and mobile application technologies. Unlike classic application stacks like LAMP and MEAN, VAS is fundamentally an attempt to combine "best choice" technologies to fulfill it's stated goals and major stack versions represent different technology combinations.

First, VAS is technology agnostic. At any given point in time, VAS recommends a concrete combination of technologies, but unlike traditional stacks, the technologies change over time.

Second, VAS explicitly the principles by which the technologies are chosen. The principles, as well as the scope, are themselves are subject to change, though generally at a much slower rate than the technology stack.
