# Vulgar Application Stack

The Vulgar Application Stack is an attempt to identify a "best choice" combination of web and mobile application technologies. Unlike classic application stacks like LAMP and MEAN, VAS is fundamentally an attempt to combine "best choice" technologies to fulfill it's stated goals and major stack versions represent different technology combinations.

VAS is fundamentally technology agnostic. Whatever combination the community judges best meets the stated principles at a given point in time is the VAS stack. As a consequence, it's appropriate to understand the major versions of VAS as each defining a distinct stack, with VAS itself being a ruleset by which these stacks are generated.

VAS differs in another aspect in that classic stacks focus more or less exclusively on runtime technologies. In contrast, VAS addresses the whole development cycle and includes development, testing, and deploy technologies alongside the standard backend+DB+UI bits.

Refer to the current [Stack Components](./Stack_Components) for the concrete functions and technologies covered in this version.

## Scope

At the highest level, scope is divided between development, testing, deploy, and runtime concerns. Essentially, VAS defines everything necessary to deliver final code to production. The Product Specification and Product Plan are the inputs to VAS and the output is the code running in production.
